# Introduction to OpenCV in C++

In this workshop, we will explore how to use the OpenCV library in C++ to create programs for image processing and computer vision. The session will start with an introduction to the fundamentals of C++ programming. Next, we’ll explore OpenCV, from basic image and video input/output to advanced techniques in image manipulation and analysis.

You’ll learn to execute computation on images, applying filters, detecting edges, and using blob detection. We’ll also explore advanced OpenCV features, like object recognition and integrating deep learning models. Throughout, I’ll introduce technical demonstrations drawing from my practice as an artist and experience as a creative technologist, including applications in creative robotics.

Please be punctual and bring your laptop! I recommend installing the OpenCV library before the start of the lesson. Instructions are available here for both Mac and Windows, and I’ll be available to assist you with any installation issues in class.

## OpenCV
**OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library.**

**OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications** and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. Being an Apache 2 licensed product, OpenCV makes it easy for businesses to utilize and modify the code.

The library has more than 2500 optimized algorithms, which includes a comprehensive set of both classic and state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms. **These algorithms can be used to detect and recognize faces, identify objects, classify human actions in videos, track camera movements, track moving objects, extract 3D models of objects, produce 3D point clouds from stereo cameras, stitch images together to produce a high resolution image of an entire scene, find similar images from an image database, remove red eyes from images taken using flash, follow eye movements, recognize scenery and establish markers to overlay it with augmented reality, etc.** OpenCV has more than 47 thousand people of user community and estimated number of downloads exceeding 18 million. The library is used extensively in companies, research groups and by governmental bodies.

**It has C++, Python, Java and MATLAB interfaces and supports Windows, Linux, Android and Mac OS**. OpenCV leans mostly towards real-time vision applications and takes advantage of MMX and SSE instructions when available. A full-featured CUDAand OpenCL interfaces are being actively developed right now. There are over 500 algorithms and about 10 times as many functions that compose or support those algorithms. **OpenCV is written natively in C++** and has a templated interface that works seamlessly with STL containers.
